# Entry 1
## Background
Me and a fellow coursemate daniel adesanya along with an oxford university student karlton charles have decided to collaborate by participating in quantitative trading firm Optiver's Ready Trader Go competition.
## What I have done
I have researched the background of the project by watching the recommended instructional videos and taken extensive notes. i have also reviewed the example auto trader they attached and tried to examine how it works.

## What I have learned 
When it comes to trading, there are different types of financial products that are traded on various exchanges. These products include stocks, futures, indexes, ETFs, and options. A stock option is a derivative whose price is derived from the stock price and other parameters. Similarly, a future is also a derivative whose price is derived from the stock price.

An index is a combination of stocks, and the index price represents the collective value of those stocks. An ETF/Index tracker represents an index and is traded like a stock. Options based on an ETF are also available.

Market participants can be directional or non-directional. Market makers calculate the price of a financial instrument and create a market. Risk management is an essential aspect of trading, and hedges are used to neutralize the risk parameter.

Financial products are traded on exchanges with each product having its own order book. Order types such as market, limit, fill or kill, and immediate or cancel orders are available. Algorithmic traders can create an algorithm to send specific orders based on certain conditions.

Pairs trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that involves comparing two different financial instruments. The volumes in which the instruments are traded are determined in such a way that changes in their market prices have no impact on the total profit or loss. Creating a winning algorithm involves considering factors such as pricing, hedging, order types, and updating orders.


## Initial Goals
To learn more about algorithmic trading and how to implement different algorithmic trading strategies in python


## Next Steps to achieve my Goals
Get to round 2 of this competition by allocating a reasonable amount of time into this challenge with my colleagues. This will give me a better understanding of how to construct an efficient pair-trading algorithm work.
